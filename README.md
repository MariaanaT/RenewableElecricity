# Renewable Electricity
Renewable Electricity output studied based on data from World Bank 

#### Mini project 3, Machine Learning Course, Ã…bo Akademi, March 2019

The dataset from the World Bank contains information on 76 economic indicators for numerous countries as well as for some groups of countries. The task: 

1. Cluster the indicator values for countries for your selected indicator for all available years
2. Select 3 countries which changed clusters during the years
3. Find a reason for the change. This means that you should select for each of the 3 countries another indicator whose change possibly motivated the country's cluster change.

I choose to study **Renewable electricity output (% of total electricity output)**. Renewable electricity is the share of electricity generated by renewable power plants in total electricity generated by all types of plants. 

Running this code requires downloading data in csv-format from https://data.worldbank.org/topic/climate-change?end=2014&start=1980

Running this code requires downloading data in csv-format from https://data.worldbank.org/topic/climate-change?end=2014&start=1980
The dataset from the World Bank contains information on 76 economic indicators for numerous countries as well as for some groups of countries.

I studied **Renewable electricity output (% of total electricity output)**. Renewable electricity is the share of electricity generated by renewable power plants in total electricity generated by all types of plants.
